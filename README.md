# SCMA-using-Machine-Learning
Abstractâ€”SCMA is a NOMA scheme that can be proved
really efficient for 5G communication. Non-orthogonal
multiple access (NOMA) is one of the most promising radio
access techniques in next-generation wireless communications.
The recent spotlighted deep learning technologies are of
significant potential in solving many communication
engineering problems. For 5G networking one of the major
requirements is high spectral density along with low latency.
SCMA (Sparse code Multiple Access) is an essential
combination process of encoding at the transmitter side and
decoding at the receiver along with an addition of noise by the
wireless channel. We come across the conventional methods i.e
MPA algorithms. Log MPA, max Log MPA and MPA
algorithms have their own complexities and accuracy. SCMA
has low latency so we will try to implement the SCMA
codebook designs using Machine Learning for the receiver
channel to enhance spectral efficiency and implement wireless
channels. The main emphasis is on the codebook
implementation of SCMA using Deep Learning. We take a
certain example which contains j number of users and k
number of codebooks and stick to this example throughout the
project. Using factor graphs we implement the algorithm and
compare the performance. Despite having excellent Machine
learning and Deep Learning Models and they Give results In
terms Of Predictions and classifications, datasets like these are
difficult to explain.

Different parameter are used in each output.
In this experiment, we have implemented a ML model with
learning rate = 0.001 and number of hidden layer for
encoder is 4 and 5 hidden layer in decoder. Number of input
layer are 32 each and number of layer are 48 each for
decoder part.

Below is a plot of Training loss and test loss on x- axis and
number of epoch count on y-axis.
